I created a graphical interface in WinDev to collect information by a brightness sensor


I created a graphical interface in WinDev that allows, via an electronic board with a light sensor, to measure the room's brightness and display it on this interface. At the top of the interface, the user needs to enter their email, password, first name, and last name, take a photo of themselves, and log in. Then, the second page allows connecting via Bluetooth and measuring the brightness.
